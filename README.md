# Customer-Segmentation-Using-their-spending-personality

Customer segmentation using spending personality helps an organization/company for the betterment of sales and production. In this project, we have used Kaggle uncleaned dataset, after cleaning it to create a meaningful conclusion. Through this dataset, we seek the best way to segment customers as per their spending on particular projects by their age, education level, marital status, etc. We have used various types of clustering such as K-means, GMM, and fast clustering to know which algorithm works better reducing the computational cost. We have performed Exploratory data analysis before performing modeling to have an understanding of how models can capture various patterns and compare the results which are evident by humans. Although, after performing modeling we received detailed results of how each category has an impact on the other. As well as what kind of combinations of customers can yield fruitful results. This information can be useful to merchants who are willing to increase their profit by knowing their customers well.
